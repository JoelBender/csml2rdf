# csml2rdf

This project contains an application that converts the "classic"
BACnet base types and objects that are provided in CSML to SHACL rules
for validating BACnet content encoded in RDF.

The rules for encoding BACnet content in RDF is in a proposal to the
Data Modeling Working Group within ASHRAE SSPC 135, a.k.a., the BACnet
Committee.
